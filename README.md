A python script to orginize all your saved songs into monthly playlists

## Demo
Here is an awful recording of the script working for the first time, and me being excited about it: shakey and downsized video https://youtu.be/BIJhtVM27Lk

## Theory

## Support
If you can run python3 and make HTTP requests, you should be good.

## Usage
Make a spotify app and use those credentials in keys.py (keys.example.py shows format). I'll actually write something here in the future.
